            <p>Mumbai, formerly Bombay, city, capital of Maharashtra state, southwestern India. It is the country’s financial and commercial centre and its principal port on the Arabian Sea.Located on Maharashtra’s coast, Mumbai is India’s most-populous city, and it is one of the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world. It was built on a site of ancient settlement, and it took its name from the local goddess Mumba—a form of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism—whose temple once stood in what is now the southeastern section of the city. It became known as Bombay during the British colonial period, the name possibly an Anglicized corruption of Mumbai or perhaps of Bom Baim (“Good Harbour”), supposedly a Portuguese name for the locale. The name Mumbai was restored officially in 1995, although Bombay remained in common usage.</p>

It is bounded by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the north, Himachal Pradesh to the northeast, Haryana to the south and southeast, and Rajasthan to the southwest and by the country of Pakistan to the west.

The city of Chandigarh, within the Chandigarh union territory, is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana.The word Punjab is a compound of two Persian words, panj (“five”) and āb (“water”), thus signifying the land of five waters, or rivers (the Beas, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej).</p>

It is Rajasthan’s most-populous city.A walled town surrounded (except to the south) by hills, the city was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh to replace nearby Amber (now Amer, a part of Jaipur) as the capital of the princely state of Jaipur (founded by the Rajputs in the 12th century CE). Jaipur grew dramatically in size in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, doubling its population between 1991 and 2011. It has a mixed Hindu-Muslim population. The city was the site of numerous bombing attacks in the early 21st century, with mosques and Hindu temples being targets.</p>

        <h2> My Travel experience</h2><p>I like to travel different places, I had traveled to a northern part of India such as Shimla, Punjab, Manali and Jammu Kashmir, these places are very cold and are known for cool climate. The best time to visit is between May till August, as you can encounter the snow and chilling winter around everywhere. We also visited Dharmashala a peaceful place to visit, while traveling we had a rough ride, as it is a hilly region, driving needs to be done safely.  The temperature is very low during the night and early morning time. You can also visit the west part of India, known as Jaipur, Rajasthan, also called the Pink city. The best places to visit are the Mahals built during the Kings empire, where they withhold strong and massive structure, inside as well as from outside. Travelling makes me feel refreshed and excited to meet and experience the food, lifestyle, and people with diverse language and culture. Overall it is a good experience to travel around the world.</p>
